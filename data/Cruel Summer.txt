Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boys, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new the shape of your body, it's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh, It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em, no rules in breakable Heaven but
Ooh, whoa oh, It's a cruel summer
With you hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
So cut the headlights, Summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed you'll be the last to know
Oh, it's new The shape of your body, it's blue the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh, It's a cruel summer
It's cool that's what I tell 'em, no rules in breakable Heaven but
Ooh, whoa oh, It's a cruel summer
With you I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said, "I'm fine", but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I, snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed, "For whatever it's worth"
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil
It's new the shape of your body, it's blue the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh, It's a cruel summer
It's cool that's what I tell 'em, no rules in breakable Heaven but
Ooh, whoa oh, It's a cruel summer
With you I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said, "I'm fine", but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I, snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
And I screamed, "For whatever it's worth"
"I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
