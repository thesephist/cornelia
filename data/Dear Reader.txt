Dear reader
If it feels like a trap, you're already in one
Dear reader
Get out your map, pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader
Burn all the files, desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
(You should find another)
Dear reader
Bend when you can, snap when you have to
Dear reader
You don't have to answer, just 'cause they asked you
(You should find another)
Dear reader
The greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader
When you aim at the devil make sure you don't miss
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it
If you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and
My friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose
When you're playing solitaire
You should find another guiding light
Guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light
Guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another
You should find another
Guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another
You should find another
