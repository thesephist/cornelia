See you in the dark, All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us, You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces, Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone
'Cause we break down a little
And when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it, And our pieces fall right into place
Get caught up in the moments, Lipstick on your face, So it goes
I'm yours to keep, And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you, So it goes
Met you in a bar, All eyes on me, your illusion is
All eyes on us, I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone
'Cause we break down a little
And when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it, And our pieces fall right into place
Get caught up in the moments, Lipstick on your face, So it goes
I'm yours to keep, And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you, So it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?  1, 2, 3
And our pieces fall (pieces), Right into place
Get caught up in the moments (caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face, So it goes
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you, So it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
