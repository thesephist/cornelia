I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple,
Never easy, never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
And I can't, breathe, without you, but I have to,
Breathe, without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
And I can't, breathe, without you, but I have to,
Breathe, without you, but I have to
It's two A.M. feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy,
Easy for me It's two A.M. feelin' like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
I can't, breathe, without you, but I have to,
Breathe, without you, but I have to
