Today was a fairytale
You were the prince, I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale, Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress, You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there, It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way, Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale, Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothin' made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around, Yeah yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way, Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way, Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around
I can feel my heart, It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?,  I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way, But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way, Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way, Today was a fairytale, Today was a fairytale
