New to town with a made up name
In the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen
Another name goes up in lights, Like diamonds in the sky
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oooh
Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused, 'Cause you don't feel pretty
You just feel used, And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one
It was a few years later. I showed up here and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oooh
Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
