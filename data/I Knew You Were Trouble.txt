Once upon a time a few mistakes ago, I was in your sights
You got me alone, You found me
You found me, You found me
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back, Without me, Without me, Without me
And he's long gone, When he's next to me
And I realize, The blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, You're drowning, You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, Now I see, Now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey
I knew you were trouble when you walked in, oh-ooh, So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in, So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been, yeah
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me, Or her, Or anyone, Or anything
I knew you were trouble when you walked in, So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there, knew it right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Uuh) now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Trouble, trouble, trouble, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
