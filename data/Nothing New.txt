They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly when you're soarin' through the sky
Shoots you down and then they sigh, and say
"She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?
How long will it be cute
All this crying in my room
Whеn you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affеction?
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?
And someone else lights up the room?
People love an ingénue
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?
I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at 17
She'll know the way, and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh, whoa, whoa. Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, whoa, oh
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at 18 but nothing at 22?
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
Will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
