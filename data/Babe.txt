What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? No
What a shame
Didn't want to be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(What about your promises, promises, promises? No)
What a waste
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said no one else, how could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe (yea, yea, yea)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you
Since you admitted it (oh-oh), I keep picturing (oh-oh)
Her lips on your neck (oh-oh), I can't unsee it (oh-oh)
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
What a shame
Didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe? (Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
You really blew this, babe (babe, eh, yeah, eh)
We ain't getting through this one, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
You said no one else
This is the last time I'll never call you, babe (yeah, yeah, yeah)
