I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were seventeen and crazy running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way"
He was tryna to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things"
Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Ooh, ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh dancing with me
Ooh, ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
"Oh, my what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things
