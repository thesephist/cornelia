I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder 'bout me
And I just wanna tell you it takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you, And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye, And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you, and I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe, it's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe, In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you, And I almost do
And I just wanna tell you, it takes everything in me, not to call you
And I wish I could run to you, and I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder 'bout me
