You said, "I know", When I said, "I need some time, need some space to think about all of this"
You watched me go, And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back, And I said, "When can I come back?"
And you said, that's when, when I wake up in the mornin'
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin', Laughin' when I'm cryin'
And that's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby that's when
I said, "I know", When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone, Came all your tears
And I said "Leave those all in our past"
And you said "When can I come back?"
And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the mornin'
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin', Laughin' when I'm cryin'
And that's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face, I'll let you in, and baby that's when
And you said, "Honestly, when you were gone, did you ever think of me?"
And I said, that's when, when I woke up in the mornin'
That's when it was sunny or stormin', Laughin' when I was cryin'
And that's when you were waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby that's when, (That's when it was sunny or stormin')
When I'm laughin', when I'm cryin'
(That's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate) that's when I miss you
(That's when, when I see your face)
That's when I want you, That's when I love you, That's when
