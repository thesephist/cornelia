Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, Burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night, When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars, Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, Little taste of heaven
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway
But you're untouchable, Burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night, When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars, Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together, Come on, come on, Oh
In the middle of the night
We could form this dream
I wanna feel you by my side, Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, Little taste of heaven
I'm caught up in you, Untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night, When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars, Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on, Say that we'll be together, come on, come on
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
