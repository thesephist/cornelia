I'm walking fast through the traffic lights, Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, Or fades in time
And I never saw you coming and I'll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, Is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, Four blue eyes
So you were never a saint, And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain, Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
I never saw you coming, And I'll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate, You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good, And right and real
And I never saw you coming, And I'll never be the same
I never saw you coming, And I'll never be the same
This is a state of grace, This is the worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game, Unless you play it good and right
