Cory's eyes are like a jungle, He smiles; it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window, In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, does he know, Will you ever know?  You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone, Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be, The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind, So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say "hey, by the way, You're beautiful
Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone, Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful
If you and I are a story, That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
You're beautiful, Every little piece, love; don't you know?
You're really gonna be someone, Ask anyone
And when you find everything you've looked for
I hope your love leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't, Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
