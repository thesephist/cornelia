Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger down in the park, Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well-wishes for ya
Ooh, this place is the same as it ever was, Ooh, but you don't like it that way
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh), Dorothea (Ah-ah)
Ooh, you'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines, Ooh, from you I'd buy anything
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well...
Ooh, I guess I'll never know, Ooh, and you'll go on with the show
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea (Uh-uh), Dorothea (Ah-ah)
