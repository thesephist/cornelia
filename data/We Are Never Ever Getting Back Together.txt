I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying this is it I've had enough
Because like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
You called it off again last night
But this time I'm telling you
I'm telling you,
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you hide away And find your piece of mind with some indie record That's much cooler than mine
You called me up again tonight
But this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say never say never
So he calls me and he's like'
I still love you'
And I'm just like 'this is exhausting'
We are never getting back together
Like ever
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
