Long handwritten note, Deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, When you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, Your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake, In lonely beds, In different cities, And time
Is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, And darlin' they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Distance, timing, Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, Could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, For the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, Beautiful tragic, Beautiful tragic, Beautiful
What we had a beautiful magic love there (uh-uh)
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
