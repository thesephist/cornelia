I like the way you sound in the morning,
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus,
I watch you talk you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cuz I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face, oh,
I've never been so wrapped up,
Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted
I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer,
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees, I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
Whoa oh I need you baby, Don't be afraid please
Jump then fall, jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
Say that you wanna be with me too
I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall
Jump then fall baby, Jump then fall into me, into me
Every time you smile, I smile, And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall, jump then fall into me, into me yeah
