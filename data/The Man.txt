I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, What's that like?
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, I'd be the man
They'd say I hustled, Put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads
And question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And we would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez
I'm so sick of running, as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, I'd be the man
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashin' my dollas I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad, So it's okay that I'm mad
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)
Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (as fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (hey!)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again!)
'Cause if I was a man (if I was man), Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, I'd be the man (oh)
I'd be the man (yeah), I'd be the man (I'd be the man)
