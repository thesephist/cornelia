I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up on my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago, Now you try on callin' me, baby, like tryin' on clothes
So prove to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa, And all at once
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities, the taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
So prove to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa, And all at once
Is the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa, And all at once
