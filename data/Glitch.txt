We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
And what's in my system
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been two thousand one hundred and 90 days of our love blackout
The system's breaking down (the system's breaking down)
I think there's been a glitch
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch
A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance, let's dance
Glitch
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch
