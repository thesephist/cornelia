I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking, trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one, who feels the way I do
I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah, but that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know,
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl
Trying to find a place in this world
Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl
