I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a the green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
'Cause darlin', it was good (uh-ey, uh-ey)
Never lookin' down (uh-ey, uh-ey)
And right there where we stood (uh-ey)
Was holy ground (uh-ey, uh-ey, uh-ey, oh-oh)
(Uh-ey, uh-ey, uh-ey, oh-oh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground (uh-ey, uh-ey, uh-ey, oh-oh)
(Uh-ey, uh-ey, uh-ey, oh-oh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
