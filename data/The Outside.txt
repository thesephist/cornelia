I didn't know what I would find
When I went lookin' for a reason I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothin' seems to work the first few times, Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late, so you see
You could have helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
How could I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
How can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
On the outside, lookin' in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
