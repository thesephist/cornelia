Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open
The tricky thing
Is yesterday, we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards
Winnin' battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
(Keep your eyes open)
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
So here you are
Two steps ahead and stayin' on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got somethin' they don't
Yeah, you got somethin' they don't
You just gotta keep your eyes open
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
(Keep your eyes open)
Everybody's waitin' for you to break down
Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
