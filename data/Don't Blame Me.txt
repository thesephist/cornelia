Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and
Toyin' with them older guys
Just to play things for me to use
Something happened for the first time, in
The darkest little paradise
Shakin, pacin', I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say she's gone too far this time
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes, love your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
I get so high, oh
Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time, yeah every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
Usin' for the rest of my life, oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life, oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (you ain't doin' it)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')
I get so high, oh
Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
