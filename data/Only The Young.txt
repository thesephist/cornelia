It keeps me awake, the look on your face the moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time, You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered, this time
But only the young, Only the young can run
Can run, so run, and run, and run
So every day now, You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV, You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget
They aren't gonna help us, Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this, We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over, But it's just begun
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (only the young)
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time
Up there's the finish line
Only the young can run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (can run)
Up there's the finish line
So run, and run, and run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (so run)
Up there's the finish line
And run, and run, and run
Only the young
