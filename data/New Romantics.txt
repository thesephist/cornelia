We're all bored, We're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better, We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin, We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly, We are too busy dancing
So get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
We're all here the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back, It's all in the timing
It's poker, He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love, But all we want is danger
We team up, Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey most of them are true
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly, We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free
Please take my hand and please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (it's so romantic)
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly, We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
