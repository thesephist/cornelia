She can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me, And I just wanna show you, She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable instead of just invisible
There's a fire inside of you that can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light, No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be, And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you, She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh we're invisible, I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize, I just want to show you, she don't even know you,
Baby let me love you, let me want you".
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
