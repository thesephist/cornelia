I remember
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Lost in situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I Have to say By the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was
Making fun of you
But 15 seconds latеr they were clapping too?
Thеn what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight?
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch ...her?
It's just a question
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize, out of time
She was on your mind
With some meathead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Caught in politics and gender-roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was
Making fun of you
But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you put up more of a fight
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch ...her?
It's just a question
Does it feel like everything's just like second-best after that
Meteor strike?
And what's that, that I heard, that you're still with her
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable And right But tonight...
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was
Making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you put up more of a fight?
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch ...her?
It's just a question
